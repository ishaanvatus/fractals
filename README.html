<h1 id="fractals-in-c-from-scratch">Fractals in C from scratch</h1>
<p>Just something I made to learn C more and also have fun with
fractals, since they have such simple definition and the code required
is often a short recursive function.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m using the Netpbm format because creating an image is simple and
requires no dependencies, just simple file I/O.</p>
<p>Pretty Basic Programming thing to do in my honest opinion.</p>
