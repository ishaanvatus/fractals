# Fractals in C from scratch

Just something I made to learn C more and also have fun with fractals, since they have 
such simple definition and the code required is often a short recursive function.

I'm using the Netpbm format because creating an image is simple and requires no dependencies, just simple file I/O.


Pretty Basic Programming thing to do in my honest opinion.
